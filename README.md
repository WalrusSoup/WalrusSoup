### :rocket: Full Stack Wildcard
I am a full stack engineer & wildcard person, covering everything from vue to php to aws infrastructure and salesforce. I have wordpress experience, too! I love cleaning ðŸ§¹ both IRL and in codebases. Refactoring is one of my favorite things to do.

90% of my work is closed source. However, you can find a few open source projects with MyOutDesk that I have built below:

- [Tailwind-Formatter](https://github.com/WalrusSoup/Tailwind-Formatter)
- [Laravel GA4](https://github.com/MyOutDeskLLC/Laravel-Analytics-V4)
- [SalesforcePhp](https://github.com/MyOutDeskLLC/SalesforcePhp)
- [Salesforce Duplicate File Scanner](https://github.com/MyOutDeskLLC/SalesforceDuplicateFileScanner)
