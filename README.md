I am a wildcard person. I do a bit of everything: vue (w/ typescript), php, rust, infrastructure (aws), and salesforce.

I love cleaning ðŸ§¹ both IRL and in codebases. Refactoring and deleting code is one of my favorite things.

You can find a few open source projects that I have built below:

- [Tailwind-Formatter](https://github.com/WalrusSoup/Tailwind-Formatter)
- [Laravel GA4](https://github.com/MyOutDeskLLC/Laravel-Analytics-V4)
- [SalesforcePhp](https://github.com/MyOutDeskLLC/SalesforcePhp)
- [Salesforce Duplicate File Scanner](https://github.com/MyOutDeskLLC/SalesforceDuplicateFileScanner)
- [AutoBcc](https://github.com/MyOutDeskLLC/auto-bcc)
