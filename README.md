### :rocket: Full Stack Wildcard
I am a full stack engineer & wildcard person, covering everything from vue to php to aws infrastructure and salesforce. I have wordpress experience, too!

Most of my software is closed source. However, you can find a few open source projects with MyOutDesk that I have built below:

- [SalesforcePhp](https://github.com/MyOutDeskLLC/SalesforcePhp)
- [Salesforce Duplicate File Scanner](https://github.com/MyOutDeskLLC/SalesforceDuplicateFileScanner)
- [Salesforce Rest (Deprecated)](https://github.com/MyOutDeskLLC/SalesforceRest)
